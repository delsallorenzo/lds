Club Culture Month celebrates the vibrant culture of clubbing with workshops, talks, dance classes, and club nights. My design strategy for the poster and social media contents utilized a typical club aesthetic with bold colors, rational typography, and geometric elements that reflected electronic music rhythms. The main graphic element features the CCM initials, created with a grid-based typography and circular shapes. The circle is an iconic symbol in the music world, commonly seen in speakers, DJ consoles and vinyls. For social media, I added motion graphics with a simple gravity-inspired reveal effect to enhance engagement.
